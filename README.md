# CSVOL
Comma Separated Value Organization Language, or CSVOL (\kasv√§l\\), is a query language that stores data in CSV files.

You can write CSVOL code in the main.csvol file. It is still a work in progress, so there is an extremely limited amount of functionality.

#### Built with
The interpreter is written in entirely Java. All development occurred on Repl.it.

#### Roadmap
We plan on moving meeting notes to a group website in the future. General meeting notes for all of Wichita CPU's operations can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1penokzeQKJ7PXM5JvUvn8pT_uso4QuSFwjQhdeqkrpU/edit.

Implement the following file commands:
- Create new file [Done]
- Pull existing file to read
- Drop existing file [Done]

More additions will be decided upon and listed during general meetings.
