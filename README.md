# CSVOL
Comma Separated Value Organization Language, or CSVOL (\kasv√§l\\), is an interpreted language that specializes in reporting and manipulating CSV files.

You can write CSVOL code in the main.csvol file. Alternatively, you may instruct through the command-line by writing PULL REPL to a blank main.csvol file.

#### Why CSVOL?

While the intended application of CSVOL is very similar to those of Unix utilities, such as AWK, SED, and GREP [(1)](https://davidlyness.com/the-functional-and-performance-differences-of-sed-awk-and-other-unix-parsing-utilities), they come with a few issues.

AWK does not support modularization [(2)](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~afb/20013/plc/slides/perlintro-03.html). In addition, math operations are difficult to express in SED [(3)](http://sed.sourceforge.net/sedfaq6.html)[(4)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/36949/addition-with-sed). Finally, GREP lacks replacing capabilities [(1)](https://davidlyness.com/the-functional-and-performance-differences-of-sed-awk-and-other-unix-parsing-utilities). CSVOL attempts to solve a few of their limitations by placing the positive aspects of said Unix utilities under one umbrella.

While Perl, Python, Java, and other general-purpose languages provide CSV file parsing capabilities, they too come with their own setbacks for developers. Perl does not offer an interactive shell [(5)](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bvanderz/cs460/notes/perl/perl1.html#title3). In addition, Perl does not provide strong portability [(5)](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bvanderz/cs460/notes/perl/perl1.html#title3). A minor setback seen in Python, Java, and other languages is that indentation and braces are mandatory to define blocks of code [(6)](https://data-flair.training/blogs/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-python/). CSVOL attempts to address these setbacks.

#### Built with
The interpreter is written in entirely Java. All development occurred on Repl.it.

#### Roadmap
We plan on moving meeting notes to a group website in the future. General meeting notes for all of Wichita CPU's operations can be found on [our group's public Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1penokzeQKJ7PXM5JvUvn8pT_uso4QuSFwjQhdeqkrpU/edit).

Will implement the following functions:
- Maybe Turing completeness?

Current functionality:
- Enable REPL environment
- Create new file
- Pull existing file to read
- Drop existing file
- Print contents of file
- Edit contents of file
- Delete contents of file

More additions will be decided upon and listed during general meetings.

#### Developers
The current members of the [Wichita Computer Programmers' Union](https://repl.it/@wichitacpu) are all students of [Wichita High School East](https://www.usd259.org/east), and CSVOL is the group's first project. Members that actively worked on CSVOL's development were:
- [Abir Haque](https://abirhaque.github.io/)
- William Kieu
