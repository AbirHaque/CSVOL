# CSVOL
Comma Separated Value Organization Language, or CSVOL (\kasv√§l\\), is an interpreted language for managing databases in CSV file format.

You can write CSVOL code in the main.csvol file. Alternatively, you may instruct through the command-line by writing PULL REPL to a blank main.csvol file.
